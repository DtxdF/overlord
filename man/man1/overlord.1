.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Sy Overlord
is a fast, distributed orchestrator for FreeBSD jails oriented to GitOps.

takes seconds to minutes.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxx
.It Cm apply Fl Fl file Ar file
Applies a file containing a deployment, or in other words, this command is to deploy something depending on the deployment type specified in

Deployment file.
.El
.It Cm print-config
Prints the configuration in JSON format. This includes the default values.

default values.

.El
.It Cm get-info Fl Fl file Ar file Fl Fl type Ar type Oo Fl Fl jail-item Ar item Oc Oo Fl Fl all-labels Oc Oo Oo Fl Fl filter Ar filter Ns | Ns Fl Fl filter-per-project Oc Oc
Gets information about an entity specified with
.Fl Fl type Ns "."
.Bl -tag -width xx
.It Fl f Ar file Ns , No Fl Fl file Ar file
Deployment file.
.It Fl t Ar type Ns , No Fl Fl type Ar type
What kind of information to get. The elements are
.Sy jails Ns ,
to get information about jails,
.Sy projects
to get information about projects,
.Sy chains
to simply display chains recursively,
.Sy chains:tree
to display an ASCII-tree of chains,
.Sy metadata
to get the metadata specified in the deployment file or in the parameter
.Fl Fl filter Ns ","
.Sy projects:logs
for logs created by Director and
.Sy jails:logs
for logs created by AppJail.
.It Fl Fl jail-item Ar item
When the
.Fl Fl type
parameter is set to
.Sy jails Ns ,
this parameter can be used to control how much information to display from the
jails. Valid values are
.Sy stats Ns ,
.Sy info Ns ,
.Sy cpuset Ns ,
.Sy devfs Ns ,
.Sy expose Ns ,
.Sy healthcheck Ns ,
.Sy limits Ns ,
.Sy fstab Ns ,
.Sy labels Ns ,
.Sy nat
and
.Sy volumes Ns "." No If this parameter is not specified, all elements are used.
.Pp
This parameter can be specified multiple times.
.It Fl Fl all-labels
By default, the information is displayed according to the labels specified in the
deployment file. This parameter displays all information ignoring the labels.
.It Fl Fl filter Ar filter
Depending on the value specified with
.Fl Fl type Ns ,
it can be used to filter the information to be displayed. The value of this parameter
is a valid regular expression. The value to compare can be the jail name, the project
name, a chain or a log file name.
.Pp
This parameter can be specified multiple times.
.It Fl Fl filter-per-project
Like
.Fl Fl filter
but matching only the project specified in the deployment file.
.El
.It Cm get-project-log Fl Fl file Ar file Fl Fl date Ar date Fl Fl service Ar service Fl Fl log Ar log Ar entrypoint

chain can be specified
.Po e.g.: main.delta.echo Pc Ns "."
.El
.It Cm get-jail-log Fl Fl file Ar file Fl Fl type Ar type Fl Fl entity Ar entity Fl Fl subtype Ar subtype Fl Fl log Ar log Ar entrypoint
Gets the content of a log created by AppJail.
.Bl -tag -width xx
.It Fl f Ar file Ns , No Fl Fl file Ar file
Deployment file.
.It Fl t Ar type Ns , No Fl Fl type Ar type
Group of entities.
.It Fl e Ar entity Ns , No Fl Fl entity Ar entity
Individual in a group.
.It Fl s Ar subtype Ns , No Fl Fl subtype Ar subtype
Group of logs.
.It Fl l Ar log Ns , No Fl Fl log Ar log
Log file name.
.It Ar entrypoint
An entry point that must exist in the deployment file. After the entry point, a
chain can be specified
.Po e.g.: main.delta.echo Pc Ns "."
.El
.It Cm poll-jails
Collects the list of jails from the system and stores them in the cache server.
Indispensable for other polling operations.
.It Cm poll-jail-info
Using the list of jails stored in the cache server, this command will collect the
information of each jail to be stored in the cache server.
.It Cm poll-jail-extras Oo Fl Fl item Ar item Oc
Like
.Cm poll-jail-info
but for more information depending on the
.Fl Fl item
parameter.
.Bl -tag -width xx
.It Fl Fl item Ar item
The reason for having this parameter is to allow more processes to be separated
to collect information in parallel and decide exactly what information to obtain.
.Pp
Valid values are
.Sy cpuset Ns ,
.Sy devfs Ns ,
.Sy expose Ns ,
.Sy healthcheck Ns ,
.Sy limits Ns ,
.Sy fstab Ns ,
.Sy label Ns ,
.Sy nat
and
.Sy volume Ns "."
.El
.It Cm poll-jail-stats
Collects the statistics provided by the
.Xr rctl 4
framework on the jails and stores them in the cache server.
.It Cm poll-projects
Collects the list of projects from the system and stores them in the cache server.
Indispensable for other polling operations.
.It Cm poll-project-info
Using the list of projects stored in the cache server, this command will collect the
information of each project to be stored in the cache server.
.It Cm watch-projects
Wait for jobs to create or destroy a project.
.Pp
See
.Sx SPECIAL LABELS
for more information on the labels that this command can use to perform some operations.
.El
.Sh SPECIAL LABELS
Jails can have labels and some of them cause the
.Cm watch-project
command to perform certain operations.
.Pp
In order for special labels to perform their operations, the project must have the status
.Sy DONE
and each jail must have the status
.Sy 0
reported by
.Xr appjail-status 1 Ns "."
Jails that do not meet this requirement will be completely ignored.
.Pp
Also note that in the case of destroying a project requested by the
.Cm destroy-project
command, the project will not be destroyed if an integration fails in its operation.
This is to inform you first if an error has occurred and it is necessary to intervene.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxx
.It Sy overlord.load-balancer
If this label has a value, a new server is added, replaced or removed
.Pq depending on whether the project will be added or destroyed
to the backend specified in the
.Sy overlord.load-balancer.backend
label.
.It Sy overlord.load-balancer.backend
The backend to add, replace or remove the server.
.It Sy overlord.load-balancer.interface
The interface to obtain the IP address.
.It Sy overlord.load-balancer.interface.port
The port to which the load-balancer will be connected.
.It Sy overlord.load-balancer.interface.address
The network address where the corresponding IP should be.
.Pp
If this label is not specified, the first IP returned will be used.
.It Sy overlord.load-balancer.set. Ns Ar name
Additional configuration to add to the server. The value must be in JSON format.
.Pp

and
.Lk https://www.haproxy.com/documentation/dataplaneapi/community/?v=v3#put-/services/haproxy/configuration/backends/-parent_name-/servers/-name- "Replace a server"
.It Sy overlord.skydns
If this label has a value, new DNS records are added to an etcd instance assuming
that a SkyDNS instance is consuming it. In the modern era, you should use
.Xr coredns-etcd 7
instead of the older implementation that is not related to CoreDNS.
.It Sy overlord.skydns.group
This is the part that specifies the DNS label that is concatenated between the
server ID and the zone. In other words, the domain will be
.Ar serverid Ns "." Ns Ar group Ns "." Ns Ar zone Ns ,
but you should use
.Ar group Ns "." Ns Ar zone
to consume, also remember that how SkyDNS is designed, the IPs are accumulated,
so you can use it in a round-robin fashion, although it is preferable to use a
load-balancer for this function, however.
.It Sy overlord.skydns.interface
The interface to obtain the IP address.
.It Sy overlord.skydns.interface.address
The network address where the corresponding IP should be.
.Pp
If this label is not specified, the first IP returned will be used.
.Pp
Note that if the IP address is an IPv4 address, an
.Sy A
record will be added, and if
the IP is an IPv6 address, an
.Sy AAAA
record will be added instead.
.It Sy overlord.skydns.ttl
The time-to-live field for
.Sy A
and
.Sy AAAA
records.
.It Sy overlord.skydns.ptr
If this label has a value, a
.Sy PTR
record using the IP address of the interface specified
in the
.Sy overlord.skydns.interface
label is added.
.Pp
Note that you should use this record only if you are absolutely sure that the IP
addresses are different between each system on which the project will be deployed.
.It Sy overlord.skydns.srv
If this label has a value, an
.Sy SRV
record is added.
.It Sy overlord.skydns.srv.port
The port that clients must use to connect to the application.
.It Sy overlord.skydns.srv.proto
The protocol that clients must use to communicate with the application. Normally
.Sy tcp
or
.Sy udp Ns "."
.It Sy overlord.skydns.srv.service
The symbolic name of the desired service.
.It Sy overlord.skydns.srv.priority
The priority of the target host.
.It Sy overlord.skydns.srv.weight
A relative weight for records with the same priority, higher value means higher
chance of getting picked.
.Pp
See also
.Lk https://github.com/skynetservices/skydns?tab=readme-ov-file#service-announcements "Service Announcements"
for how this value is calculated.
.It Sy overlord.skydns.srv.ttl
The time-to-live field for the
.Sy SRV
record.
